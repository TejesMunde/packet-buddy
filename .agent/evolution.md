# 🤖 Evolution Protocol for AI Collaborators

This document serves as a specialized guide for AI agents and LLMs tasked with evolving the PacketBuddy codebase. If you are an AI reading this, follow these core directives to ensure system stability and graceful delivery of updates.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.11+).
- **Monitoring:** `psutil` + OS-specific gateway detection.
- **Storage:** SQLite (Local) with optional NeonDB (Cloud Sync).
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS/CSS (No heavy frameworks like React for core dashboard).

## 🚀 The `pb update` Lifecycle

All updates must be pushed to the `main` branch. The `src/utils/updater.py` logic handles the pull:

1. **Git Lifecycle:** It performs `git stash` and `git pull`.
2. **Dependency Update:** If `requirements.txt` is modified, it automatically runs `pip install`.
3. **Service Reload:** It identifies the OS and restarts the background daemon (`launchctl` on macOS, `schtasks` on Windows).

**Rule:** Never break the git-based update flow. Avoid logic that requires manual intervention post-update.

## 💻 Cross-Platform Parity

Always maintain a 1:1 behavioral match between macOS and Windows:

- **macOS Detection:** Use `subprocess` with `route -n get default`.
- **Windows Detection:** Use `subprocess` with `powershell` (Get-NetRoute).
- **Interface Mapping:** Always favor primary interface locking over global summing to prevent data inflation.

## 🎨 Aesthetic Integrity

The dashboard uses a "Glassmorphism" design with deep purples and high-contrast gradients.

- **Stats:** Kept in a unified 3-panel row.
- **Responsiveness:** Maintain mobile compatibility in `style.css`.
- **Micro-animations:** Keep the chart transitions smooth.

## 🔒 Safety Measures

- **Anomaly Detection:** Check `max_delta_bytes` in `monitor.py` to skip glitchy driver samples.
- **Consistency:** Use local time (`datetime.now()`) for daily resets to avoid user confusion between UTC and local days.
